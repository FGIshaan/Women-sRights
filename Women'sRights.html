            <h2>Equal Pay & Women's Rights</h2>
            <div class="paragraph-image">
                <p class="font-size-change">Many women can be seen at an outdoor event in this image supporting each, demanding for equal rights in the workplace and demanding for the same number of wages for the same amount of work. The Equal Pay Case of 1969 tried to get rid of any discriminatory laws against women in the workplace. These laws made sure that women can find and maintain employment. New laws were enacted to ensure that men and women are treated and compensated equally.</p>

                <p>Two women can be seen in this image who are holding signs/posters trying to raise awareness about the pay gap between men and women for doing the same job in the workplace. Doing this ensures that men and women are both treated with respect and have a value in the workplace. The movement began because women were paid less than men for doing the same work and were not treated equally. The main reason for this was that women were getting paid less for doing the same task because of their gender. The main motive for this movement was to ensure that women get the same pay as men for doing the same job as them in the workplace. Protestors like these were important for the equal pay movement because they not just raised awareness about the topic, but they also encouraged other women who were not a part of the movement to join them. The unjust treatment of people based on their gender in the workplace was attempted to put an end to by the 1984 Sex Discrimination Act.

                <p>3 women can be seen holding protesting banners that demands better conditions in the workplace. The banners also demand for the same pay as men for doing the same work. These women are trying to get rid of the differences in the workplace and they intended to end the practice of paying men and women differently for the same task. Important events in this image includes the 1969 Equal Pay Case, which tried to remove any discriminatory laws equal pay; the 1984 Sex Discrimination Act, which attempted to get rid of gender discrimination; and the 1986 Affirmative Action legislation, which promoted equal opportunity.

                <p>A woman can be seen having an important/intense conversation with 2 men in this image. The source providing this image states that the conversation is about the unfair treatment in the workplace with women. They were also talking about the wage gaps difference between men and women, as well as the less amount of job opportunities that are given to women when compared to men. Probably the most important event that is related to this image is the 1984 Sex Discrimination Act which was made to try to stop unfair treatment based on gender. In 1986, Affirmative Action rules were put in place to give everyone the same chances. The new rules helped women get better jobs and fair pay.</p>

                <p>In this image, 4 women can be seen holding banners demanding for equal pay in the workplace. They are stating the fact that it is not fair for women to get paid less for doing the same amount for work that men must do, and men still get paid more. Significant events that are related to this image are the 1969 fair Pay Case, which was completely based on the unequal pay in the workplace and tried to get rid of discrimination based on gender; and the 1986 Affirmative Action legislation, which supported fair opportunities for all. Due to these efforts, important rules that make sure women get fair pay and fair treatment at work have been changed to help them more.

                <p>This image shows a very important movement in this history of equal pay and work right movements. This image shows a lot of women with banners demanding for equal pay for doing the same amount of work. This image is relevant to the pay fairness check 1997, this law had the aim to get rid of the gender pay gap by adding protections against any attackers that might harm any protestors during something like a discussion or a meeting. This law also prevented punishment for talking about salaries, making employers show that pay differences are not because of gender, and making penalties stronger for not paying equally.</p>

                <p>A women can be seen working with a big machine in a factory manufacturing something in this image. This image seems like from the time when the men from the time were forced to go to the 2nd world war and their posts in the factories were empty, so women took their vacant posts. This time was important for the equal pay movements was because women were now able to do the same tasks/jobs as only men could to before and they stated to demand for same wages for doing the same amount of work.
